      - Quality: Good units produced vs. total units produced

   1.2. Throughput
      - Units produced per hour/shift/day
      - Production rate vs. target rate

   1.3. Cycle Time
      - Time to complete one unit
      - Actual cycle time vs. standard cycle time

## 2. Quality Metrics
   2.1. First Time Through (FTT) / First Pass Yield (FPY)
      - Percentage of units produced correctly the first time without rework

   2.2. Defect Rate
      - Number of defective units per million opportunities (DPMO)
      - Defects per unit (DPU)

   2.3. Scrap Rate
      - Percentage of material scrapped during production

   2.4. Rework Rate
      - Percentage of units requiring rework

## 3. Inventory Management
   3.1. Inventory Turnover Ratio
      - How often inventory is sold and replaced over a period

   3.2. Work-in-Progress (WIP) Inventory
      - Value and quantity of partially completed products

   3.3. Raw Material Inventory Levels
